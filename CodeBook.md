##CodeBook for uci_har_avg_mean_std.txt

**Description:** This is the code book for an output dataset generated by the run_analysis.R script which can be obtained at the GitHub URL below. The output dataset contains the averages of all mean and standard deviation variables found in the source data, grouped by Subject ID and Activity ID/Names. More information regarding how to use run_analysis.R is in README.md file.

**Source Data:** The source data for the output dataset is based on the *Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset*. This source data captures accelerometer and gyroscope data from 30 subjects of ages 19-48 performing multiple tasks. The full source data as well as additional information can downloaded here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

**Data Transformations:** In order to arrive at the output dataset, the run_analysis.R script performs several data transformations from the source data. These steps are listed below:
1. The script reads all the testing and training data and merges them into one large data frame; the Subject ID as well as Activity ID of each row is added in the process
2. All variables (columns) containing mean and standard deviations are kept while all other variables are discarded; weighted average of frequency (meanFreq) and all additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample (gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean) are discarded as well
3. Activity Name is added to each row based on matching with Activity ID
4. The data is aggregated (collapsed) by taking the mean of each column, splitting or grouping by both Subject ID as well as Activity ID (meaning that it is also grouped by Activity Name)
5. The data is then sorted in order by Subject ID, then by Activity ID/Name
6. Finally, the resulting tidy dataset is output as a space-delimited file with a header row and named *uci_har_avg_mean_std.txt*

**Variables:** 

The output dataset adheres to a nearly identical naming scheme as the source data. While information is given below, more information can also be obtained in the *feature_info.txt* file located within the source link above.

*Naming Scheme*
- "t" prefix: time domain signals
- "f" prefix: frequency domain signals
- "-XYZ" suffix: denote 3-axial signals in the X,Y, Z directions
- "-mean" suffix: mean value
- "-std" suffix: standard deviation value

*Variable List*

Note: Unless stated otherwise below, the variable is an average of the signal as defined by the naming scheme above.

- SubjectID: The ID of the subject ranging from 1-30
- ActivityID: The ID of the activity being performed, ranging from 1-6
- ActivityName: Description of the activity recorded (6 types)
